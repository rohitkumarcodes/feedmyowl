description: Introducing FeedMyOwl — a calm, minimalist RSS reader that respects your attention.
---

We're building FeedMyOwl because we think reading deserves better tools.

Most feed readers today are designed to maximize engagement — unread counts, push notifications, algorithmic sorting. They treat your attention as a resource to be extracted rather than a gift to be respected.

FeedMyOwl is different. It's a minimalist RSS and Atom feed reader built around a simple idea: **you decide when to read**.

## What makes FeedMyOwl different

- **No background fetching.** Your feeds are only refreshed when you press the button. No anxiety-inducing notifications pulling you back.
- **No unread counts.** We don't track what you've read or haven't read. Open the app when you feel like reading, close it when you're done.
- **No algorithms.** Your feeds are shown in chronological order. No AI deciding what you should see first.
- **No social features.** Reading is a focused, personal activity. We keep it that way.

## Getting started

FeedMyOwl is free for up to 10 RSS or Atom feeds. Sign up, add your favorite feeds, and start reading in a calmer way.
