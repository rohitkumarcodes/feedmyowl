title: design system alignment across app and website
date: 2026-02-07

This release aligns both surfaces with the new typography-first design system.

## Web app

- Updated color and type tokens to match the project design spec.
- Simplified the three-pane layout and removed list-pane drag resizing.
- Moved add-feed behavior to a shared inline flow used by toolbar and sidebar.
- Refined reader typography with a narrow measure and serif body text.

## Website

- Rebuilt the public site styling around a single-column, reading-first layout.
- Added dedicated Docs and Changelog sections.
- Switched blog and changelog index pages to title-only streams.

This change keeps both products visually related while preserving their different jobs.

Follow-up: search and shortcut updates landed later in
[global article search and updated keyboard shortcuts](/changelog/global-search-and-shortcuts/).
