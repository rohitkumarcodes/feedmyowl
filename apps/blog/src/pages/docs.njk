    FeedMyOwl is a minimalist RSS and Atom reader built around one question:
    does this help you read better, or does it distract you?
  </p>

  <h2>Core Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No unread counts, badges, or urgency mechanics.</li>
    <li>No push notifications; refresh is always user-driven.</li>
    <li>No social layer, reactions, or recommendation loops.</li>
    <li>Typography and whitespace are treated as product features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How To Use FeedMyOwl</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Add your feed subscriptions.</li>
    <li>Press refresh when you want new entries.</li>
    <li>Use j/k and Enter to read quickly without losing focus.</li>
  </ol>
