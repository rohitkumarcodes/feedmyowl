{# About Page — explains the mission and philosophy behind FeedMyOwl #}

<p>
  FeedMyOwl is a minimalist RSS/Atom feed reader built around one idea:
  <strong>your attention matters</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Most modern feed readers have become noisy, feature-bloated, and designed
  around engagement metrics rather than reading quality. FeedMyOwl takes the
  opposite approach: fewer features, better reading.
</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Sign up and add your favorite RSS or Atom feeds (up to 10 for free).</li>
  <li>Press "Refresh" when you're ready to see what's new.</li>
  <li>Read in a clean, focused interface with no distractions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What we don't do</h2>

<ul>
  <li>No background polling or push notifications.</li>
  <li>No unread counts or badges.</li>
  <li>No algorithms or recommendations.</li>
  <li>No social features.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We believe reading should be a calm, intentional activity. FeedMyOwl is
  designed to support that.
