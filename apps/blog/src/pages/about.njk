{# About Page — explains the mission and philosophy behind feedmyowl #}

<p>
  feedmyowl is a minimalist RSS and Atom reader built around one idea:
  your attention matters.
</p>

<p>
  It keeps the reading loop simple: add feeds, refresh when you are ready, and
  read without interruption.
</p>

<h2>how it works</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Add your RSS and Atom feeds.</li>
  <li>Press refresh when you want to fetch updates.</li>
  <li>Read in a calm interface designed for focus.</li>
</ol>

<h2>what we do not do</h2>

<ul>
  <li>No push notifications.</li>
  <li>No unread counts or badges.</li>
  <li>No recommendation engine.</li>
  <li>No social features.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If something helps you read better, it belongs here. If it distracts, it
  stays out.
