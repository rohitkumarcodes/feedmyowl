  <h1>FeedMyOwl is a calm RSS and Atom reader.</h1>

  <p>
    Most feed readers optimize for urgency. FeedMyOwl does the opposite: it gives
    you a quiet place to read.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are no unread counts, no push notifications, and no engagement loops.
    You refresh when you choose, then read in a clean three-pane workspace where
    the words stay in focus.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is simple: protect your attention so reading can feel deliberate
    again.
