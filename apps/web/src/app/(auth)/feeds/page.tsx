/**
 * Feeds Page — Main Reading Interface
 *
 * This is the core page of FeedMyOwl. It shows:
 *   1. A list of the user's subscribed feeds
 *   2. Articles from those feeds
 *   3. A "Refresh" button to fetch new articles
 *   4. An "Add Feed" form to subscribe to new feeds
 *
 * This is currently a placeholder that will be built out
 * with actual feed display and management UI.
 *
 * The reading experience is sacred (Principle 7) — this page
 * must be calm, focused, and distraction-free.
